# Financial Markets Headline Sentiment Gauge
I want to be able to gauge the sentiment of Financial news headlines captured and saved 12-hourly using Python.
The roadmap initially looks like this:

Find major Financial news websites;
Use BeautifulSoup(bs4) to extract headlines from major news networks;
Extract news Headlines;
Use Python to extract key words from the headline text;
Analyse the key words to determine a negative or positive sentiment on the headline using; 
Look for consensus amongst different major news outlets; and
if consensus exists, notify me!!


I will be working from Jupyter Lab initially, I do not know how long this will take but, it seems interesting.
